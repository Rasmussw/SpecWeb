      For all questions or inquiries, please contact:
      <a href="mailto:support@climbalong.com">support@climbalong.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome to ClimbAlong. Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”)
      and our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) carefully because they govern
      your use of all our Services including apps, webpages, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      All ClimbAlong websites, services and apps are collectively called the
      “Services”. The Services are owned and operated by NorthTech ApS
      (“NorthTech ApS,” “we,” or “us”). These Terms of Service as well as the
      Privacy Policy are integral parts of the Contract between you and
      NorthTech ApS regarding your use of the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      By downloading, installing, or otherwise accessing or using the Service,
      you agree that you have read and understood, and, as a condition to your
      use of the service, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions
      including our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Services. If
      you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company or other
      legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to
      bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case,
      “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms at any time. If we do so, we’ll let you know
      either by posting the updated Terms on the Site, or through other
      communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we
      update them, or when you use the Services. If you continue to use the
      Services after we have posted updated Terms, you are agreeing to be bound
      by the updated Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the updated Terms,
      you may not use the Services anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use our Services, you must be of legal age or have the consent of your
      parents and/or legal guardians.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use certain features of the Services you’ll have to create an account.
      When you create an account, you can do this via the Services or in some
      cases through your account with certain third-party Social Networking
      Services such as Facebook or Google (an “SNS Account”). Please refer to
      our Privacy Policy to see how we collect and use your personal
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      To protect your account, keep the account details and password
      confidential, and notify us right away of any unauthorized use. You’re
      responsible for all activities that occur under your account. Parents are
      responsible for the acts of their children who use our Services.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-lg font-medium lg:text-xl">1. License of use</h2>
    <h4 class="font-medium">1.1 Limited License.</h4>
    <p>
      Subject to your ongoing compliance with these Terms, we grant you a
      limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable
      license to access and use the Services in compliance with the Contract
      including these general Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-medium">1.2 License Restrictions.</h4>

    <h4 class="font-medium">1.3 Feedback.</h4>
    <p>
      If you choose to provide input and suggestions regarding problems with or
      proposed modifications or improvements to the Services, you hereby grant
      us an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully paid,
      royalty-free right to exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any
      purpose, including to improve the Service and create other products and
      services.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-lg font-medium lg:text-xl">2. Copyright Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We respect copyright law, and we expect our users to do the same. It is
      our policy to terminate cooperation with any user of the Services who
      repeatedly infringe or are believed to be repeatedly infringing the rights
      of copyright holders including us.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-lg font-medium lg:text-xl">3. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <h4 class="font-medium">3.1</h4>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will we be liable for
      any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages
      (including damages for loss of profits, goodwill, or any other intangible
      loss) arising out of or relating to your access to or use of, or your
      inability to access or use, the Service, or any materials or content on
      the Service, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including
      negligence), statute, or any other legal theory, and whether or not we
      have been informed of the possibility of damage.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-medium">3.2</h4>
    <p>
      Our aggregate liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating
      to the use of or any inability to use any portion of the service or
      otherwise under these terms, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, is
      limited to the amount you have paid to us for access to and use of the
      Service for the event or circumstance giving rise to claim during the last
      6 months.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-medium">3.3</h4>
    <p>
      Each provision of these terms that provides for a limitation of liability,
      disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages is intended to and does
      allocate the risks between the parties under these terms. This allocation
      is an essential element of the basis of the bargain between the parties.
      Each of these provisions is severable and independent of all other
      provisions of these terms.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-lg font-medium lg:text-xl">

      5. Content Ownership, Responsibility and Removal.
    </h2>
    <h4 class="font-medium">5.1 Definitions.</h4>
    <p>
      For purposes of these Terms: (i) “Content” means text, graphics, images,
      music, software, audio, video, works of authorship of any kind, and
      information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided,
      transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Services; and (ii)
      “User Content” means any Content that Users (including you) provide to be
      made available through the Services. Content includes without limitation
      User Content.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-medium">5.2 Our Content Ownership.</h4>
    <p>
      We do not claim any ownership rights in any User Content and nothing in
      these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use
      and exploit your own User Content. Subject to the foregoing, we
      exclusively own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services and
      Content, including all associated intellectual property rights. You
      acknowledge that the Services and Content are protected by copyright,
      trademark, and other laws. You agree not to remove, alter, or obscure any
      copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices
      incorporated in or accompanying the Services or Content.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-medium">5.3 Rights in User Content Granted by You.</h4>
    <p>
      By making any User Content available through the Services you hereby grant
      us a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license, with
      the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works
      based upon, distribute, publicly display, and publicly perform your User
      Content in connection with operating, promoting, and providing the
      Services and Content to you and to other Users.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-medium">5.4 Your Responsibility for User Content.</h4>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and
      warrant that you own all your User Content, or you have all rights that
      are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under
      these Terms. You also represent and warrant that neither your User
      Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made
      available through the Services, nor any use of your User Content by us on
      or through the Services will infringe, misappropriate, or violate a third
      party’s intellectual property rights, rights of publicity or privacy,
      moral rights, or result in the violation of any applicable law or
      regulation. You are solely responsible that your User Content could not be
      deemed by a reasonable person to be objectionable, profane, indecent,
      pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful, or otherwise
      inappropriate.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-medium">5.5 Removal of User Content.</h4>
    <p>
      You can remove your User Content by specifically deleting it. However, in
      certain instances, some of your User Content (such as posts or comments
      you make or messages you send) may not be completely removed and copies of
      your User Content may continue to exist on the Services. We are not
      responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to
      remove or delete) any of your User Content.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-medium">5.6 User Content Disclaimer.</h4>
    <p>
      We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or
      other users post or publish, and we will not be in any way responsible or
      liable for User Content. We may, however, at any time and without prior
      notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole
      judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable or irrelevant
      to the Service. You understand that when using the Service, you will be
      exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that
      User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You
      agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you
      have or may have against us with respect to User Content. If notified by a
      user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to
      these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole
      discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right
      to do at any time and without notice. For clarity, we do not permit
      copyright-infringing activities on the Service.
    </p>
    <h4 class="font-medium">5.7 Monitoring Content.</h4>
    <p>
      We do not control and do not have any obligation to monitor: (a) User
      Content; (b) any content made available by third parties; or (c) the use
      of the Service by its users. You acknowledge and agree that we reserve the
      right to, and may from time to time, monitor all information transmitted
      or received through the Service for operational and other purposes. If at
      any time we choose to monitor the content, we still assume no
      responsibility or liability for content, or any loss or damage incurred
      because of the use of content. During monitoring, information may be
      examined, recorded, copied, and used in accordance with our Privacy
      Policy.
